# Email-SMS-spam-classifier
In today's digital age, spam has become an increasingly pervasive issue. To combat this, I embarked on a project to develop a powerful email/SMS spam classifier.

Leveraging the capabilities of Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries like NLTK and string, I began by meticulously preprocessing the text data, cleaning it up for effective analysis. A deep dive into exploratory data analysis provided valuable insights into the dataset, helping me understand the nuances of spam and legitimate messages.

To transform text into a machine-readable format, I employed both Bag-of-Words and TF-IDF techniques. With the data prepared, I experimented with a variety of machine learning models including Naive Bayes, Decision Tree Classifier, and Support Vector Classifier. By meticulously comparing accuracy and precision metrics, I identified the optimal model for my classifier.

This project has been a rewarding journey, and I'm excited to apply this model to effectively filter out spam, saving users valuable time and protecting them from potential threats.
